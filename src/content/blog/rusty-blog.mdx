# **Parallelism and Concurrency in Go**

&nbsp; 

Go makes it simple to write programs that can do many things at once. It does this through goroutines and channels, which provide a clean way to handle concurrency and parallelism without a lot of overhead.

&nbsp; 

### **1. Goroutines**

&nbsp; 

A goroutine is a lightweight thread managed by the Go runtime. You can start a goroutine by using the `go` keyword before a function call. They are extremely cheap compared to operating system threads.

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "time"
)

func printMessage(message string) {
    for i := 0; i < 3; i++ {
        fmt.Println(message)
        time.Sleep(time.Millisecond * 500)
    }
}

func main() {
    go printMessage("Hello from goroutine") 
    printMessage("Hello from main")
}
